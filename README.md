# PingPongExample

This repository contains an example demonstrating the utilization of LiteNetLib's packet system in MPT. I have attempted to make the code as understandable as possible, but feel free to reach out if you still don't quite understand it. If you require additional material to aid the replication of your mod for MPT support, do not hesitate to contact me.

Note: this is not meant to be a compilable example, this is meant to be reference material.
